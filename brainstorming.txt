// Step 5: Implement Unit Tests



    TEST CASES FOR: index.php
        
        TEST CASE 1) 
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/index.php
            PURPOSE: Test that index.php loads as expected without any errors or problems loading resources
            EXPECTED RESULTS: Page loads, displaying name of website, "welcome <user> text", and a search bar
            which allows the user to enter in a search term.
            
        TEST CASE 2)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/index.php?prodName=barbie
            PURPOSE: Test what our page does when we send it data that it doesn't need and can't use.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Page will ignore data in GET request and perform same expected result as 
            TEST CASE 1.
            
        TEST CASE 3) 
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io
            PURPOSE: Test whether index.php loads by default without being explicitly included in the url.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Same result as TEST CASE 1.
            
        TEST CASE 4) 
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/index.php (via POST)
            EXTRA PARAMETERS: include the following search query in the POST body:
                prodName=candy?manufacturerName=Pocky
            PURPOSE: Ensure that our page isn't confused by POST requests and loads normally, ignoring
            any data in the POST body.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Same as TEST CASE 1.
            
    TEST CASES FOR: getresults.php
    
        NOTE: getresults.php accepts queries as GET requests, which it then processes, searches the DB for, and sends
        the data along to the results.php page.
    
        TEST CASE 1)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php
            PURPOSE: Ensure that when users access this page directly they are either redirected or receive and error
            of some sort.
            EXPECTED RESULT: User is redirected to index.php.
            
        TEST CASE 2)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php?prodName=refrigerator
            PURPOSE: Ensure that the page handles GET requests and processes them correctly.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Results are returned from the DB for the term "refrigerator" and then the user is 
            directed to results.php where the results are displayed.
            
        TEST CASE 3)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php
            EXTRA PARAMETERS: include the following query in the POST body:
                 prodName=candy?manufacturerName=Pocky
            PURPOSE: Ensure that the page doesn't try and handle post requests and that it is not confused by them.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Redirect back to index.php
            
        TEST CASE 4)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php?prodName=refrigerator&otherThing=somethingElse
            PURPOSE: Ensure the page only handles parameters in the GET request that it actually cares about.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Results are returned from the DB for the term "refrigerator" and then the user is 
            directed to results.php where the results are displayed.  All other terms sent in the URL are ignored.
    
    TEST CASES FOR results.php
    
        NOTE: results.php will be designed to accept search results from getresults.php and display them to the user.  On its
        own it will not display anything of value to the user.
    
        TEST CASE 1)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/results.php
            || URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/results.php?prodName=refrigerator
            || URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/results.php (EXTRA PARAMETERS: in POST body prodName=candy?manufacturerName=Pocky)
            PURPOSE: Ensure that user cannot access results.php directly without having submitted a search to getresults.php
            EXPECTED RESULT: User redirected back to index.php.
        
        TEST CASE 2)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php?prodName=refrigerator
            PURPOSE: Ensure that results recieved from getresults.php are displayed correctly.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Page displays the product name, the product photo, the product's manufacturer, and the products price.
            
        TEST CASE 3)
            URL: https://cs360-projectb-group20-pfohlj.c9users.io/getresults.php?prodName=cheese
            PURPOSE: Ensure that when searches with no results display "no results" gracefully.
            EXPECTED RESULT: Displays the message "No results found" and a link back to index.php
