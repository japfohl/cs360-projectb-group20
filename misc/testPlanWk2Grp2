Group 2: Joe, Collin, Carlos  Create a user account page that **show all the values**, 
and **which ones the user has chosen**.  Also Group 2 will create some **UI niceness**: 
a product title, padding, etc. Consider implementing the "Values Based Search Behavior" 
user story. All development will be done on the assumption that User id=1 is logged in

User Dashboard test ideas

DB cases
1. Confirm that user values are pulled from users-values/vals
2. Confirm that all non-user-selected values are pulled from vals table
3. Confirm that none of non-user-selected values are contained in the user-selected values
4. Confirm that new values are inserted into the users-values table
5. Confirm that deleted values are not present in the users-values table

UI cases
6. Confirm that when a user updates a value in any way, the UI reflects the change
7. Confirm that the correct number of selected values are displayed on the page
8. Confirm that the correct number of de-selected values are displayed on the page
9. Confirm that when a user a hovers over value element, a copy display is triggered
10. Confirm that the correct copy is displayed with values
11. Confirm that the correct name of values is displayed
12. Confirm that the user's name is displayed correctly on the page
13. Ensure that a button on the user interface triggers the mysql delete command
14. Ensure that a button on the user interface triggers the mysql insert command
